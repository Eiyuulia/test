                A member of the Council and the Guardian of "Civilization," a concept crafted by mankind.
                <br><br>
                As a living embodiment of the sum of mankind's efforts—the mark that humans have left on the world—she
                is far removed from her fellow members, as well as other lifeforms. Due to not being created by the
                Gods, she was free to choose her own appearance, and decided to make herself owl-like, after the bird
                that symbolizes wisdom.
                <br><br>
                She is gentle, wise, and an unbelievably hard worker. As a well-traveled vagabond, she is blessed with a
                wealth of knowledge of the world. She has seen, heard, and experienced so many things that she has
                forgotten most of them, one of them being her own name.
