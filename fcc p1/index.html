                Subaru Natsuki is a NEET who is suddenly summoned to a fantasy-like world. Just after arriving, he is
                killed while trying to help a young half-elf he befriends, Emilia, who is a candidate to become the next
                ruler of the Kingdom of Lugunica, only to revive some hours in the past. After dying some times, Subaru
                realizes that he has the power to turn back time after his death.

                After successfully helping Emilia, Subaru starts living in one of the Mansions of the Roswaal Mathers as
                a butler. Out of gratitude and affection for Emilia, Subaru makes use of his newfound ability to protect
                her and help on her ambition to be successfully appointed as the next queen, also providing assistance
                to other friends he makes along the way, while suffering due to the pain inflicted on him every time he
                dies, and carrying along the memories of everything that happened before his power activates, which is
                forgotten by everybody except for him.
